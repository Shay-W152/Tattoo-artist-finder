            Bio:In 2016 Saje earned her B.F.A. In Illustration, and an art career back in California was calling her name. We were sad to see her go.2018 brought some changes to the studio and we were able to lure Saje Gary back to Atlanta and Thunderbolt Tattoo. She loaded up the car with art supplies, and some cute outfits, and made the journey home... lucky for us. She’s a pleasure to be around, and super talented.

When I am not tattooing you can usually find me on a hike with my Shiba Inu, Khaleesi, or reading a book on the beach at Waimanalo Bay. I’m an Aries sun, Aquarius moon, Gemini rising. If you know what that means, then you’re as weird as me and we should get along just fine

           Bio:After a terrible explosion at a rock factory, gamma radiation mixed human DNA and the worlds 2nd largest stone. The resulting aftermath gave rise to Justin P Duncan, a super rock with all the powers of a real life human being. With a hard exterior shell and the creative ambition of a teenager wanting to make his own youtube channel, Justin creates works of art that made even the Hungarian mafia cry. As a reword for blessing their hearts with his advanced understanding of culture, they made him captain of the kick ball team, where he meets his future bff forever Cody “second from the top dollar” Lee. Justin enjoys Jiu-jitsu, uncomfortably large fires, and a somewhat solid handshake.

           Bio: Frosty has been working for Tattoo Factory for his entire career, he started his apprenticeship back in 2005 under Master Tattooist Jerry Thrash, when we were across the street in the old shop. Since then, he has been in the deep end of our industry, working hard to perfect his skill and give his clientele the tattoo they deserve.His style has been heavily influenced by the street art movement of the last couple of decades. Like tattoo art it has a raw nature not seen in many other art forms. Tattooing is often motivated by a preference on the part of the client to communicate directly with the public at large, free from perceived confines of the formal art world.

Electric Ladyland- New Orleans, Lousiana 
Artist 35: RICHARD
           Bio:Not much is known about the origins of the one they call Richard, though it is whispered in hushed tones that he emerged from the depths of an ancient land known now as the Midwest. Once confronted about his beginnings by a drunken hobo, he sliced the man in half with a large sword. It is as yet unclear where he produced this sword from. Eventually, he was taken in by a woman and cared for the best way she knew how, which meant a lot of weapons training and bare-knuckle boxing. It was then that he picked up a love for the art of tattooing. Together they stormed the city of New Orleans, where he found the tattooing field to be a lucrative business. Most famous, however, is his method of not so much using a needle and ink, but instead staring down a person’s skin until colors and designs raise up purely out of fear.

Artist 36: SCOTT
           Bio:Scott is, for all intents and purposes, not a real person. He is more machine than man, a droid of sorts, imported for the government, digitally combined with a giant gorilla only found in the deepest jungles. Scott was deployed as a bringer of destruction, and it was his life’s purpose to destroy every moving thing with laser beams shooting from his eyes and his hairy steel clawed hands wrapped around the throat of whatever crossed his path. Eventually bored of the constant destruction, he decided to travel to New Orleans and do what came naturally, tattooing. His hideous appearance was shunned, but he was eventually taken in by Juju and joined the Mid City Voodoux krewe. He chooses his victims, narrowly pointing them out with the bright dot of the laser, and demands they be seated in his chair. Those who survive, leave with a permanent mark not only from the tattoo, but his once deadly grasp.
